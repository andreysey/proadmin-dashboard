# ADR 0001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a way to document the architectural decisions made during the development of ProAdmin Dashboard. This will help current and future developers understand the "why" behind significant technical choices.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document these choices. ADRs will be stored as Markdown files in the `docs/adr` directory.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Clear technical history, easier onboarding, justified design choices.
- **Negative**: Requires discipline to keep updated.
