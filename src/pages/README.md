# Pages Layer

**Purpose**: Contains whole views/screens of the application. This layer is responsible for composing widgets and features into a full page.

## Contents
- Page components that are mapped to specific routes.

## Rules
- Can import from `widgets`, `features`, `entities`, and `shared`.
- Should strictly be for composition. Logic should ideally live in lower layers.
